#' Simulate sensor records whose response acts at a known temporal grain
#'
#' Draws units carrying a year of sensor readings and a multi-variable presence-absence response
#' whose dependence on the record is a fixed linear functional of the record at one named grain.
#' The grain is therefore known before anything is fitted, which is what makes the output usable
#' for asking whether [select_grain()] finds it.
#'
#' @section What the true grain is:
#' The response is driven by `g_ij = sum_t w_j(t) * a_i(t)`, a weighted mean of unit `i`'s latent
#' *anomaly*: the record with the seasonal cycle every unit shares and the unit's own constant
#' offset taken out, since neither of those is temporally located and a window of any width reports
#' both. The weights `w_j` are constant within the bins of one window and zero outside
#' a short stretch of them, so `g` is exactly a linear combination of that window's bin means. The
#' true grain of a mechanism is the **coarsest window of [window_matrix()] at which `g` is still an
#' exact linear functional of the representation**: at that window and at every window whose bins
#' nest inside it, no information about `g` has been averaged away, and at any coarser window some
#' has. Finer windows keep the information but spread it over more coefficients, so they lose to
#' the true grain by variance rather than by bias, which is the tension the selection has to
#' resolve.
#'
#' @section The mechanisms:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`"none"`}{No temporal signal. The driver is a standard normal drawn independently of the
#'     record, so nothing in the readings carries information about the response and no grain is
#'     correct. `grain` is `NA`.}
#'   \item{`"event"`}{An isolated event. The weights are uniform over three consecutive **day**
#'     bins at a fixed calendar position, one position per variable. True grain `"day"`: a week bin
#'     mixes the three days with four others and cannot be unmixed.}
#'   \item{`"season"`}{A smooth seasonal response. The weights are uniform over one whole
#'     **season** bin, one season per variable, cycled. True grain `"season"`: month and day bins
#'     nest inside a season so they are exact too, a year bin mixes all four seasons.}
#'   \item{`"lag"`}{A lagged, cumulative response. The weights decay geometrically over four
#'     consecutive **week** bins from a fixed anchor, one anchor per variable. True grain `"week"`:
#'     day bins nest inside weeks so they are exact too, month bins straddle week boundaries.}
#' }
#'
#' @section How the skill is set rather than emergent:
#' The driver is standardised to a standard normal by its population mean and standard deviation,
#' both computed in closed form from the generating parameters rather than from the drawn units, so
#' every draw and every chunk of a draw is on the same scale. The response is
#' `y_ij ~ Bernoulli(plogis(b0 + b1 z_ij))` with `b0` and `b1` solved by numerical integration so
#' that the marginal prevalence is `prevalence` and the population area under the ROC curve of `z`
#' is `auc`. `auc` is therefore a ceiling no fitted model reaches: the response is generated from
#' the latent record and the readings carry `sensor_sd` of measurement noise on top of it, and the
#' weights have to be estimated.
#'
#' @param n Number of units to draw.
#' @param mechanism Which generating mechanism, see The mechanisms.
#' @param variables Number of response variables. Each gets its own weights within the mechanism.
#' @param prevalence Marginal probability of presence, shared by every variable.
#' @param auc Population area under the ROC curve of the driver against the response.
#' @param from First reading instant, `"YYYY-MM-DD"`, read as UTC.
#' @param days Length of the record in days.
#' @param step_hours Sampling step in hours. Must divide 24.
#' @param seasonal Amplitude of the seasonal cycle shared by every unit, in reading units.
#' @param offset_sd Standard deviation of the unit-level thermal offset.
#' @param anomaly_sd Marginal standard deviation of each unit's AR(1) anomaly.
#' @param anomaly_days Correlation time of that anomaly, in days.
#' @param offset_effect Weight the unit-level offset enters the driver with. At the default `0`
#'   the driver reads the unit's *anomaly* alone, so a window coarse enough to average the anomaly
#'   away loses the signal. At `1` the offset carries the response as well, and since every window
#'   however coarse reports the offset, every grain is then equally good: that is the
#'   grain-invariant control, not a temporal mechanism.
#' @param sensor_sd Standard deviation of the measurement noise added to the latent record. The
#'   response is generated from the latent record; the readings returned carry this noise.
#' @param year_start `"MM-DD"` boundary of the hydrological year, passed to [window_matrix()] when
#'   the mechanism's bins are located. Use the same value when representing the readings.
#' @param seed Seed of the design: the weights and the link coefficients. Two calls with the same
#'   `seed` and different `draw` share a design and draw independent units, which is what lets a
#'   held-out deployment sample be drawn from the same population as a training sample.
#' @param draw Seed of the unit draw. Also names the units, so two draws never collide.
#'
#' @return A `timegrain_simulation`: a list with `readings`, the long table [window_matrix()] takes;
#'   `y`, the `[unit, variable]` 0/1 response; `driver`, the standardised driver `z` behind it;
#'   `grain`, the true grain or `NA`; `weights`, the `[reading, variable]` weights defining the
#'   driver; `link`, the solved `b0` and `b1`; and `design`, the settings the draw is reproducible
#'   from.
#'
#' @seealso [select_grain()], which this exists to test, and [window_matrix()], whose calendar the
#'   weights are defined on.
